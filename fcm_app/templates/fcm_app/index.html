        <h1>Welcome to TRANSrisk System Mapping Online Tool</h1>
        <p class="jumbotron" align="center" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">System Mapping* (also known as market mapping) is a stakeholder participatory analysis tool which allows the in depth exploration of the characteristics of an examined market. System Mapping is widely used to describe the relevant environment for introducing a commodity, a technology, or a policy measure within a system, sector or country, and to identify what works and what does not work as well as the respective reasons.

        <div id="collapse" class="collapse well" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
            <p align="justify">In System Mapping the analysis consists of a description of three core elements: the business enabling environment; the market or value chain; and the supporting services. More particularly, the business enabling environment includes the infrastructure and policies, as well as the institutions and processes that shape the system (e.g. market demand, consumption trends, tax and tariff regimes, investment policies, etc.). Secondly, the value chain consists of the actors who operate in the market/ sector/ or country in question and who are affected by and/or play a role in the implementation of a commodity, technology or policy measure (e.g. primary producers, importer, traders, processors, input suppliers, energy companies, wholesalers, retailers and customers). Lastly, the supporting services are the legal, financial, quality control and technical support services that exist in the examined system. The main data source for system mapping is stakeholders’ knowledge and experience.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">In TRANSrisk the System Mapping tool has been applied in each one of the 14 country case studies so as to analyse the market sectors explored in each one of them. More particularly, System Mapping supported the visualisation of the conceptual boundaries of the system in question, by identifying all relevant actors, policies and functions within key components of the innovation system, namely the Technology Innovation System (TIS) life cycle of the complete supply chain; the environment of enablers and barriers that directly or indirectly impact the system; and facilitating services that are external to the system but are fundamentally necessary. Also, System Mapping was applied to capture and explore the dynamic interactions between the aforementioned actors, policies and functions. Building on the identified system dynamics, the framework finally assisted the evaluation of identified pathways towards low-carbon, climate-resilient economies, by exploring such dynamics while also assessing different policy strategies.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">In order to easily create and modify complex system maps, a dedicated software application has been designed and developed in MATLAB and . The developed application, namely the Mapping Tool for Innovation Systems Evaluation (MATISE) enables the development of a visual narrative through a bottom-up approach, building on stakeholder knowledge of system boundaries, as well as key elements and interactions within the system. This web platform implements the functionality of MATISE in a user friendly online tool in order to support stakeholders to easily browse, create or import, and share their knowledge regarding a specific market via system mapping. Although it was originally designed for mapping the energy systems within the TRANSrisk case study countries in order to identify potential barriers in the implementation of low carbon transition pathways, the tool may be applied in a wide range of research case studies which require the collection of stakeholders’ opinion and knowledge on a particular market.
            </p>
            <p align="justify">*System Mapping was originally developed by Albu & Griffith (2005) to closely examine the characteristics of the markets into which small farmers in developing countries might enter.
